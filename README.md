## Change Log

### 09-06-2023

- I started this project today. I have created the basic structure of the project using Next.js with Jest and React Testing Library for testing.

- I have also created the basic entities for the ship, the board and the game with some basic methods.

- I have created tests for the entities and the methods. Then I used TDD to create the methods and the basic logic for the game.
